Starting today [drone.io](https://drone.io) has a free plan available for open
source projects.

[Create a free account](https://drone.io).

It will work with any project's source code that is publicly accessible (meaning
it can't require a username/password, or specific ssh key to copy/clone the
source code).

The free plan has a few limits, but it should be enough for most open source projects.
If you start running into the limits please [contact](http://docs.drone.io/contact.html) us.
